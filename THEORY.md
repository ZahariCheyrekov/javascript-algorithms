# Algorithm

    - an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem

# Algorithm analysis

    - we evaluate the performance of an algorithm int terms of its input size
    - there is no one solution that works every time and it is always good to know multiple ways to solve the problem and use the best solution, given your constraints

# Time conmplexity

    - amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

    - O(1)- constant complexity - independent of the number of items
    - O(n) - linear comlexity - proportion to the number of times
    - O(n²) - quadratic complexity - for every input, it takes n*n operations
    - O(n³) - cubic complexity

# Space complexity

    - amount of memory taken by algorithm to run, as a function of input size

    - O(1) - constant
    - O(log n)- logarithmic
    - O(n) - linear

# Represent complexity

    - Big O Notation - Worst case complexity
    - Omega Notation - Base case complexity
    - Theta Notation - Average case complexity

# Big O Notation

    - the worst case somplexity of an algorithm is represented using Big O Notation
    - describes the complexity of an algorithm using algebric terms
    - it is expressed in terms of the input
    - it focuses on the bigger picture without getting caught in the minute details

# Objects - Big O

    - Insert - O(1)
    - Remove - O(1)
    - Access - O(1)
    - Search - O(n)
    - Object.keys() - O(n)
    - Object.values() - O(n)
    - Object.entries() - O(n)

# Arrray

    - Insert/Remove at end - O(1)
    - Insert/Remove at beginning - O(n)
    - Access with index - O(1)
    - Search - O(n)
    - Push/Pop - O(1)
    - Shift/Unshift/Concat/Slice/Splice - O(n)
    - ForEach/Map/Filter/Reduce - O(n)
