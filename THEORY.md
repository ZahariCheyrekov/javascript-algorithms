# Algorithm
    - an algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem

# Algorithm analysis 
    - we evaluate the performance of an algorithm int terms of its input size
    - there is no one solution that works every time and it is always good to know multiple ways to solve the problem and use the best solution, given your constraints

# Time conmplexity
    - amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of input size

# Space complexity
    - amount of memory taken by algorithm to run, as a function of input size

# Represent complexity
    - Big O Notation - Worst case complexity
    - Omega Notation - Base case complexity
    - Theta Notation - Average case complexity
